;;; Commentary:
;; This module provides conversion utilities between linear RGB colors and
;; gamma encoded sRGB colors.
;; This is meant to complement the functions from bundled color.el module
;;
;; Constants seem to differ a little from the formulas used in the
;; XYZ color conversion functions. Since Wikipedia provides a source for
;; the computation of the constants I chose to use it (i.e. 12.92 instead of
;; 12.95 for the linear slope)

;;; Code:
(require 'color)

(defun color-gamma-encode-component-to-srgb (u)
  "Encode the component from linear to gamma-encoded.

Source : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB#Specification_of_the_transformation"
  (if (<= u 0.0031308)
      (* 12.92 u)
    (- (* (expt u (/ 2.4)) 1.055) 0.055)))

(defun color-gamma-decode-component-from-srgb (u)
  "Decode the component from gamma-encoded to linear.

  (if (<= u 0.04045)
      (/ 12.92 u)
