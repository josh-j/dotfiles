* Description

Provide persistent workspaces using Emacs 27+ tab-bar feature

** Maintainers
+ @gagbo (Author)

** Module Flags
This module provides no flags.

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el][burly.el]]
+ [[https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el][bufler.el]]

** Hacks
The =bufler-tabs-mode= is very carefully avoided, because it uses tabs in a way
that is not compatible with this module's goal (changing tabs should change your
window configuration entirely)

* Prerequisites
This module has no prerequisites.

* Features
# An in-depth list of features, how to use them, and their dependencies.

A workspace is a group of buffers sharing the same bufler-workspace (which is
the =bufler-workspace-path= buffer-local variable).

Those workspaces are shown in tabs, whose name match the
=bufler-workspace-path=

* Configuration
# How to configure this module, including common problems and how to address them.

* Troubleshooting
# Common issues and their solution, or places to look for help.
